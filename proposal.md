## ProjectSnowCrash
Spring 2016 C346 Project

This is the repository for our semester project.  We plan to use MVC 7 and Visual studio development tools to design
a banking website with all the typical features you would expect from a bank. Users will be able to apply for loans and withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds. Administrators such as bank managers will be able to manage and set up these user accounts as well as view reporting data. We will use Scrum development methodology to implement our project.
